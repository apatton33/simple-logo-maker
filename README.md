# Simple-Logo-Generator

## Description
    I was tasked through the acceptance criteria to buile an SVG logo generator. 
    Once the user inputs node index.js into the integrated terminal they should
    be prompted with questions. These questions consist of asking for text in the
    form of between 1 and 3 characters. It then prompts the user to type in the
    color of that text. Following answering that prompt it will then ask you the
    color of your shape and have you choose a shape from of list of Circle, Square, and triangle. After all prompts have been answering in the format
    required it will generate a file logo.svg. You can then preview the logo through the file explorer. I was also tasked with creating a shapes.test.js
    file where I can use jest to run unit tests on the shapes.
    I will run through the performance of the generator and the unit tests in
    the video below.
    


## Usage
   Users can use this code and node.js to generate a SVG logo through prompted
   questions.
